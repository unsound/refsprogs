=========

The purpose of this project is to provide utilities for accessing data on ReFS
volumes. As ReFS lacks documentation the utilites are dependent on independent
exploration of the on-disk format, and thus cannot yet be fully relied upon.

Currently the following utilities exist:

redb
----
A utility that prints the ReFS tree data, as much as we currently understand it.

refscat
-------
A utility that prints the data of a file, extended attribute (EA) or an
alternate data stream on an ReFS volume.

refsinfo
--------
A utility that prints information about a specific file or directory or about
the whole volume. The '-v' option provides more verbose output.

refslabel
---------
A utility that prints the label of an ReFS volume.

refsls
------
A utility that lists files on an ReFS volume. The '-R' switch allows recursive
listing, while '-a' shows hidden files and '-l' uses a long format including
timestamps.
If the '-e' option is supplied, extended attributes (EAs) are listed and the
'-s' option lists alternate data streams.

refs-fuse
---------
A FUSE driver interface to librefs allowing direct access to ReFS volumes by
mounting them in the filesystem.
